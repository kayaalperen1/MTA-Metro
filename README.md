# MTA-Metro
Scenario:

It was very nice to meet and chat with you at the event, where we just met and had a nice chat. We would love to take the next steps together to see if working together makes sense for both parties.

As we mentioned, we want to harness the power of data and analytics to optimise the effectiveness of the street teamwork that forms an important part of our fundraising efforts.

Our WomenTechWomenYes (WTWY) organises an annual gala every year at the beginning of the summer. As we are a new and inclusive organisation, we are trying to do double duty with the gala to fill our event space with individuals who are passionate about increasing women's participation in technology, while simultaneously creating awareness and outreach.

For this purpose, we place street teams at the entrances of metro stations. The street teams collect the e-mail addresses of the people they can reach and send free tickets to our gala to those who register.

Where we would like to ask for your help is to use MTA subway data, which I'm sure you know is freely available from the city, to help us optimise the placement of our street teams, so that we can reach the most people who can attend the gala and contribute to our cause.

The ball is now in your court, we will be eagerly awaiting the results of your work as soon as possible.

A study was carried out to place the street teams in the best way possible by sticking to the scenario. Worked with metro hourly passenger data.
